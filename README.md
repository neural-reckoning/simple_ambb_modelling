# Generic neural circuits account for reverberant sound localization

This repository is an interactive version of the paper *Generic neural circuits account for reverberant sound localization*
by Jean-Hugues Lestang and Dan Goodman. We show that we can re-use standard neural mechanisms to account for the data
on revereberant sound localisation of [Dietz et al., 2013](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/37/15151).
